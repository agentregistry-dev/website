Agentregistry is an open source, secure, and centralized AI artifact registry that helps you build, package, publish, discover, and govern AI artifacts, including agents, skills, and MCP servers. With agentregistry, you can seamlessly deploy AI artifacts to any environment and share them among teams.

## About A2A



## Challenges with A2A

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is emerging as the de-facto standard for how autonomous AI agents talk to each other. While most of the interest around A2A has been around stateful messaging, one of its most powerful ideas remains largely unexplored: discovery, naming, and resolution. While the A2A specification provides the critical first steps toward discovery with Agent Cards, the infrastructure for truly dynamic, scalable agent ecosystems requires additional components that the spec intentionally leaves “up to you.”

## How agentregistry fills the gaps

### Build, package, and deploy

quickly build and deploy AI applications with confidence.

Unify AI Infrastructure: Deploy and access artifacts anywhere
Package, discover and curate AI artifacts from a central source
deploy them seamlessly to any environment.
You can use agentregistry to deploy agents that are written in any framework (CrewAI, Agentic Development Kit, Kagent) to agentic platforms and Kubernetes. 

With agentregistry, you can 
- Create agents Autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and execute tasks
- MCP server Model Context Protocol servers for extended AI capabilities
- Skills Reusable capabilities and functions for your AI applications
- LLMs Large language models for easy consumption by agents 


 Before deploying to agentic platforms, you can select the MCP servers, tools, and agent skills that you want to attach to your agent.

 Accelerate applications to production by empowering developers to create, run, and deploy agents, MCP servers, and skills from agent registry with confidence.


### AI artifact governance

Selectively and control custom collection of artifacts

### Curation

Build curated artifact collections within agentregistry. Publish items selectively, and maintain end-to-end audit and control from a centralized registry.

Package, collect, and enrich AI artifacts from any source in a single centralized registry

Centralized Control – Package and collect AI artifacts from any source into a single registry
Security & Governance – Curate and approve agents, servers, and skills before company-wide deployment

### Discovery

discover, and share AI artifacts, including MCP servers, agents, and skills, 


### Data enrichment

Automatically validate and score ingested data for insights
Import AI artifacts from any registry into Agentregistry, where automatic scoring and validation enriches datasets and delivers deeper insights for operators.
Enriched Metadata – Add context to help assess trustworthiness and security



Agent Registry brings governance and control to AI artifacts and infrastructure,



## AI artifact lifecycle

Import > Curate > Deploy > Consume

## Personas

> Organizations (they do the curation)

> Development (build the agent, push to registrU_

Build, test, and publish and deploy AI artifacts with minimal dependencies
Local Development – Create and test agents, skills, and MCP servers locally
Easy Publishing – Publish your artifacts to a registry with a single command
Pull & Run Anywhere – Pull artifacts from the registry and run them in any environment instantly
Discover & Consume – Find new artifacts to add to registry or optimize existing artifacts
